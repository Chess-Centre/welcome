## How to Contribute in Issues

For any issue, there are fundamentally three ways an individual can
contribute:

1. By opening the issue for discussion: For instance, if you believe that you
   have uncovered a bug in any of the repositories for the Chess Centre.
2. By helping to triage the issue: This can be done either by providing
   supporting details (a test case that demonstrates a bug), or providing
   suggestions on how to address the issue.
3. By helping to resolve the issue: Typically this is done either in the form
   of demonstrating that the issue reported is not a problem after all, or more
   often, by opening a Pull Request that changes some bit of something in
   `Chess-Centre/app` in a concrete and reviewable manner.

## Asking for General Help

We always want to welcome help in any form, but avoid questions being deplicated or asked in the wrong area,
we encourage you to direct all your questions and requests to help to the [Chess Centre help repository][].

## Resolving a Bug Report

In the vast majority of cases, issues are resolved by opening a Pull Request.
The process for opening and reviewing a Pull Request. But raising an issue in advance against the project is always advised.
